1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. error since result was declared with let keyword therefore can only be accessed within the block scope it is declared in.
5. error since result was declared with const and cannot be reassigned another value.
6. nothing since code does not go past the previous error at line 9 and even if we get rid of line 9, we get an error snce result is a const variable and cannot be accessed outside of its block scope it was declared in.
